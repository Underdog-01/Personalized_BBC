Personalized BBC

Purpose and/or usage of this software package:

The purpose of this application is to allow an administrator the option to add personalized BBCs to a SMF forum installation.
These BBC additions have individual permission settings to allow or restrict their usage and visibility.

The added BBCodes can be of general use if permission settings regarding viewing and usage are enabled for all membergroups.

[Important Notation]:
  This modification will only hide Personalized BBC content to specified membergroups when it is installed.
  Prior to using the SMF Large Upgrade Package it is advised to put your forum in maintenance mode
  until you are able to reinstall this modification.
  Failing to follow that procedure will allow all membergroups with appropriate board permissions
  to view all those BBC's that were normally hidden.
  The same applies when uninstalling this modification.

Recommended minimal requirements:

Server:  PHP 5.3+
Database: MYSQL 5.0+ using MyISAM or InnoDB engine
Browser: HTML5 capability
SMF Version: 2.0.X - 2.1.X
